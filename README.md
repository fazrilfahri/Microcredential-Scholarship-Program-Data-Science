# Linear Regression in Car Price Prediction

This project is part of a study in data analysis and predictive modeling. We perform car price prediction based on various features using linear regression method.

## Project

This project aims to understand the relationship between features such as Horsepower, and car price. We built a linear regression model that can predict car price with good accuracy based on the features.

### Key Features
- Data exploration analysis
- Data cleaning
- Linear regression modeling
- Model evaluation
- Car price prediction
